Note for developers:

The JNI kyotocabinet binding is a bit tricky to make it work in a portable
fashion. What is done at the moment is to link to a local directory and put
symbolic links in it:

ln -s /usr/local/lib/libjkyotocabinet.so nativelib/libjkyotocabinet.so

(make sure to adapt /usr/local/lib to your local installation directory
