Note for developers:
====================

* jkyotocabinet compilation

jkyotocabinet sources available from : 
http://fallabs.com/kyotocabinet/javapkg/

On debian, to be able to ./configure, you'll need to tell the script about
environment :

MYJAVAHOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/ ./configure

Then : make install

* jni

The JNI kyotocabinet binding is a bit tricky to make it work in a portable
fashion. What is done at the moment is to link to a local directory and put
symbolic links in it:

ln -s /usr/local/lib/libjkyotocabinet.so nativelib/libjkyotocabinet.so

(make sure to adapt /usr/local/lib to your local installation directory)
