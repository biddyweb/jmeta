/**
 * Interface describing a search.
 *
 * A Search object is made to point to a list of results. It can be given as a question or as a response.
 *
 * Basically, a search possessed 3 dependences : - the source object which correspond toÂ the source of the
 * interrogation - the metaData which correspond to the criteria of the question/response - the results who
 * are all you now about the pair source/meteData
 *
 * How to represent a search ? --------------------------------------- | MetaSearch |
 * ---------------------------------------- | Source | SearchCriteria |
 * ----------------------------------------
 *
 * |
 * -----> List OF Results
 *
 * The search Hash is composed by the concatenation of the source hash and the metaData hash. Wich allow
 * anyone who as a source and question about it to built a MetaSearch (who will be in this case a question)
 * and contact anyone who have declared knowing answers.
 *
 * A quick example : To find a subtitle to a movie, you can build a search like this :
 * --------------------------------------- | Unique search | ---------------------------------------- |
 * movie.avi | st:fr | ----------------------------------------
 *
 * You do no now if they are resuts, but you can give a try to look into the DHT. If someone as declared
 * knowing answer to your question, so you will be able to contact him, retrieve the answer and add it in the
 * result list of your search.
 *
 * A search received over network is no longe in a full stable state. It only represent is potential
 * linkedObject with tmp attrbutes.
 *
 * If you really need to update your object, you can use the method UpdateFromNetwork in ModelFactory class
